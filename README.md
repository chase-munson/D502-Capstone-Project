# D502 Capstone Project


### Project Overview
This repository stores the results of my capstone project for my bachelor's degree in Data Analytics from Western Governors University. The project consisted of a data analysis task of my choosing, with a project proposal and report documenting the steps taken to complete the analysis. Furthermore, all data analysis steps were documented in a Jupyter Notebook so the project can be replicated at a later date or viewed to garner more understanding of the project's findings.

This project was initiated to determine whether there was a correlation between domestic flight delays and weather in the national airline market. More specifically, the intent was to determine whether globally changing weather patterns are causing more delays.
