This project aims to determine whether or not there is a correlation between domestic flight delays and weather in the domestic airline market. Specifically, the intent is to determine whether globally changing weather patterns are causing more or increased delays. This research question was decided upon because if weather is starting to affect the airline market more dramatically, then this information could be used to help inform the market on whether or not they need to factor this into their flight scheduling.
The scope of this project is as follows:

•	Collection of Data
•	Cleaning of Dataset
•	Statistical Analysis of  Research Question
•	Visualization of Findings
•	Final Documentation of Project

The methodology used for this project was the CRISP-DM - Cross-Industry Process for Data Mining (Schröer, Kruse, & Gómez, 2021). This methodology was chosen because it is tailor-made for data mining and was well suited for this endeavor. The programming language used for this project is Python, with Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, and Seaborn libraries. These libraries help to clean, analyze, test, and visualize the data set. All of the operations were documented in a Jupyter Notebook.
