This project aims to determine whether or not there is a correlation between domestic flight delays and weather in the domestic airline market. Specifically, the intent is to determine whether globally changing weather patterns are causing more or increased delays. This research question was decided upon because if weather is starting to affect the airline market more dramatically, then this information could be used to help inform the market on whether or not they need to factor this into their flight scheduling.
